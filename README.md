# User-Database-Demonstration
In-memory example of a database for managing user accounts.

To use the database, follow the on-screen prompts for entering user information.

Design:

User data is saved within a HashMap using the pair: userId, ClassObject. The system creates methods for creating a new object, updating existing ones, or deleting objects.
